# Tuples
In some ways, tuples are like lists.  
Tuples, are used when you know exactly how many values you want to combine and its type depends on how many components it has and the types of the components. They are denoted with parentheses and their components are separated by commas.  
Another key difference is that they don't have to be homogenous. Unlike a list, a tuple can contain a combination of several types.
