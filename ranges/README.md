# Ranges
Ranges are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be enumerated.  
Numbers can be enumerated. One, two, three, four, etc. Characters can also be enumerated.  
The alphabet is an enumeration of characters from A to Z. Names can't be enumerated. What comes after "John"? I don't know.
